NETFLIX HOMEPAGE
This code provides a basic structure for a Netflix-like homepage with a header containing a navigation menu, a hero section with a call-to-action button, and a section for popular categories. The footer is also included at the bottom of the page.
You'll also need to create a CSS file named styles.css in the same directory and include the necessary styles. Remember to replace the placeholder image filenames (netflix-logo.png, category1.jpg, category2.jpg, category3.jpg, category4.jpg, hero-background.jpg) with your own image files.
